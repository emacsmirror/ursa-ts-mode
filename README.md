An Emacs mode for [Ursa](https://github.com/ursalang). This mode requires

distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, or (at your
option) any later version. It was adapted from json-ts-mode by Theodor
Thornhill, from Emacs 29.1.

You can install ursa-ts-mode from MELPA.

Having installed the mode, run `M-x treesit-install-language-grammar RET`
and choose `ursa` to install the tree-sitter grammar.
